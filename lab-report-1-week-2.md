# Third Step
> Here is some commands that you could try out. 
- `ls` , short for "list", listing all the files in the current directory
- `ls -a` , for listing all the files including the "dot files" in the current directory
- `ls <directory>` list all the file in directory provided
- `pwd` , showing the current working directory
- `cd` , short for "change directory", it can move you to another directory
- `touch <filename>`, for creating files, such as `touch file.txt`. 
- `exit`, exit the remote `ieng6` server.

Examples of Using the command: 


# Fourth Step
> you may have some java files that you want to run on the `ieng6` server, copy that file into the remote server using `scp` command.
